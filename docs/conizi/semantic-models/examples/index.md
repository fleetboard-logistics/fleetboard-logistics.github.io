## JSON Examples

The JSON examples could be used as template to build your own messages against the conizi integration platform.

The examples are structured analogously to the models. Subdivided into the different types of transport, such as land, sea, air and into different processes such as general cargo (groupage) and full load,...

The root folder for JSON examples could be found [here]({{ site.github.owner_url }}/semantic-model/tree/{{ site.branch }}/examples){:target="_blank"}

If you are interested in land transport by truck and general cargo, you should start [here]({{ site.github.owner_url }}/semantic-model/tree/{{ site.branch }}/examples/transport/truck/groupage/forwarding){:target="_blank"}

If you decide to develop the implementation with C# directly, our [C# models and library](../site/index.html) will help you.
